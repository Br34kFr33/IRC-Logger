# IRC-Logger
Logs IRC announcements from a specific user to a MYSQL database.

# Requirements:

* MySQL
* PHP

# Setup:

1.  Create a database name it whatever you want (don't worry about importing the sql file the bot does this for you).
2.  Edit constants.php file in lib directory (Target is who you're logging).

# Start:

1.  Open terminal and start index.php script (recommend screen so you don't leave your terminal open 24/7).

# Notes:

I recommend you create a irc channel and test this out before going live with it.  I also take no responsibility on how you use this.  Use this at your own risk and don't blame me if you get a G-line or K-line.
